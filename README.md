This case study explores the monthly budget utilization of 12 departments
across two consecutive months—January and February. Each department,
representing a core functional area such as HR, Finance, IT, Marketing,
Operations, and R&D, was assigned a specific budget, and their actual
expenses were recorded. The goal of this analysis is to determine how
effectively each department adhered to its budget, identify instances of
overspending, and highlight overall spending trends.
Key performance indicators such as percentage of budget used and budget
status (Over or Under Budget) were calculated using Excel formulas. These
indicators help assess financial discipline at the departmental level and
guide future budget planning. The data is also categorized by department
type, allowing for deeper insights into how certain functions tend to
manage their finances over time.
This structured approach provides a clear picture of financial behavior
within the organization, promoting accountability and efficiency. By
analyzing two months’ worth of data, we can also begin to observe
patterns—such as which departments consistently overspend, and which
remain within their limits. This case study demonstrates how simple tools
like Excel can be used to carry out meaningful financial analysis and support
data-driven decision-making.
